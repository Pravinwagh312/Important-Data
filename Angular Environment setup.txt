1)Install Node.js: Angular requires Node.js to be installed on your system. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

sudo apt install nodejs

2)Install Angular CLI: Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps with Angular development. 
You can install it globally using npm, the package manager for Node.js, by running the following command:

sudo npm install -g @angular/cli

3)Clone the repository: Clone the repository containing the Angular project that you want to set up. 
You can do this using the git clone command followed by the URL of the repository.
git clone <repository-url>


4)Navigate to the project directory: Navigate to the directory containing the cloned project.
cd <project-directory>

5)Install project dependencies: Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
npm install

6)Serve the Angular app: After installing the project dependencies, you can serve the Angular app by running the following command:
ng serve

This will start a local development server and serve your Angular app. You can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:4200
