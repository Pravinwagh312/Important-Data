Issues: An issue is a way to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to a repository. You can use the GitHub API to fetch information about issues, such as their status, author, and assignee.
Releases: A release is a way to package and distribute a specific version of a repository. You can use the GitHub API to fetch information about releases, such as their version number, release date, and assets.
Branches: A branch is a way to work on a feature or bugfix separate from the main codebase. You can use the GitHub API to fetch information about branches, such as their name, author, and commit history.
